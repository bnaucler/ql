Quicklist is a tool for creating / sharing lists. For oneself or together with others. It's built to have a minimal and intuitive interface without clutter and with low requirements for backend capacity.

## Building
`bin/build.sh` creates the `bin/ql` binary.  
The server listens to port `9955` by default.
